# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a professional portfolio on our own. We were not given any starter code at all. The goal of this challenge was for us to use everything we had learned about html and css up to that point in order to make a webpage that appeared simarly to the example provided in the mockup.

## Usage

I have two applicable assignments I've completed at this point in the bootcamp. and those have been lined on the page. i have alsp linked the page itself along with a screenshot below.
